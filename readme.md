# Slack Readwise Integration

This application integrates Slack with Readwise Reader, allowing you to save URLs shared in Slack to your Readwise account with customizable reactions and messages.

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/AzS2fY?referralCode=mOVLfw)

## Features
- Save URLs shared in Slack to Readwise Reader when specific emoji reactions are added
- Configurable emoji reactions with custom labels and messages
- Automatic duplicate detection to prevent saving the same article twice
- Configurable rate limiting
- Secure handling of environment variables

## Deployment
Click the "Deploy to Railway" button above to start the deployment process. Don't worry if you don't have all of these yet, you'll get the rest after deploying your Slack App.

Required Environment Variables:
- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Slack Bot Token
- `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`: Your Slack Signing Secret
- `READWISE_API_KEY`: Your Readwise API Key
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: Comma-separated list of allowed hosts (e.g., your-app-name.railway.app)

Optional Environment Variables:
- `DOCUMENT_TAG`: Tag to apply to saved articles in Readwise (default: "slack-import")
- `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`: Number of requests allowed per minute (default: 20)
- `EMOJI_CONFIGS`: Configuration for emoji reactions in the format "emoji1:label1:message1;emoji2:label2:message2"

Example Emoji Configuration:
```
EMOJI_CONFIGS=bookmark:Read Later:üìö Added to your reading list;brain:Study Material:üß† Saved as study material - don't forget to add highlights!;star:Must Read:‚≠ê Marked as must-read priority article
```

This creates three different reactions:
1. :bookmark: - For general articles to read later
2. :brain: - For study materials that need highlighting
3. :star: - For high-priority must-read articles

If EMOJI_CONFIGS is not set, it defaults to using the :bookmark: emoji with a standard message.

## Usage
1. Add the Slack bot to your workspace and invite it to the desired channels.
2. When a message containing a URL is posted, react to it with one of your configured emojis.
3. The bot will:
   - Extract the URL from the message
   - Check if it's already saved in Readwise
   - If it's new, save it to Readwise with your configured tag
   - Post a custom confirmation message (based on the emoji used) in the thread

## Installation
To add the application to Slack, you *must* have deployed the back-end on Railway using the process above.

Once this is complete, you can create an application on your [Slack workspace](https://api.slack.com/) (you will need administrator permissions).

Required Slack Bot Permissions:
- **channels:history** - To read message content
- **chat:write** - To post confirmation messages
- **reactions:read** - To detect emoji reactions

Configuration Steps:
1. Create a new Slack App in your workspace
2. In "OAuth & Permissions":
   - Add the required bot permissions listed above
   - Install the app to your workspace
   - Copy the Bot User OAuth Token (this is your SLACK_BOT_TOKEN)
3. In "Event Subscriptions":
   - Enable events
   - Add your full application URL as the request URL (format: https://your-app.railway.app/slack/events)
   - Subscribe to the "reaction_added" bot event
4. Get your [Readwise API key](https://readwise.io/access_token)
5. Add all environment variables to your Railway application
6. Invite your bot to desired Slack channels

Test the integration by reacting to a message containing a URL with one of your configured emojis. You should see:
- A confirmation message in the Slack thread
- The article appear in your Readwise Reader

## Local Development
1. Clone this repository
2. Create a `.env` file with the required environment variables (see above)
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the application: `python main.py`
